Software Design Spring 2015

Interactive Programming Project Proposal!

In this project, we plan on making a 2-dimensional game with ninjas

Minimum viable product: Have a playable game that will entertain you for at least 2 minutes hopefully more.
Has gravity and some element of randomness. 

    Initial thoughts: Character is a ninja, running = constant sidescrolling, but with movement within game window.
    Things fall from the sky (shuriken, spinning axes), and buildings generate that you must vault.
    Other ninjas appear and you can kill them.
    Get as far as you can!

Learning goals: Make a fun game! Learn pygame and expand knowledge of python and interactive software design.

Stretch goals: Make it really good looking, or perhaps really cerebral. Adding a storyline and make the player emotionally invested.

Libraries: Pygame most definitely. Maybe if something comes up that is useful we will use it.

Mid-project check-in: Have a working physics and engine and collision detection.

Biggest risk: If our game design isn't very fun then it would be lame. Also we haven't used pygame before but we think it'll be cool
